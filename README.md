# Improved Malloc with Linked List

Improved Malloc is a custom memory allocation implementation in C that uses a linked list to keep track of allocated pointers, making memory deallocation (freeing) more efficient and organized.
## Features

- Efficient memory allocation using malloc with a linked list tracking mechanism.
- Easy deallocation (freeing) of all allocated memory through the linked list.
- Memory tracking details can be displayed for debugging purposes.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:COUNFOUZZ/improved_malloc.git
cd improved_malloc
```

2. Compile the improved_malloc.c file:
```bash
gcc improved_malloc.c test.c -o improved_malloc
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
./improved_malloc
```
